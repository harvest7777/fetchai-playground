# fetchai-playground

This is a quick playground environment for Fetch.ai's uAgents framework.
**Each folder is a new project**, so create a python venv **within each foler** with

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

(Or whatever your venv creation command is aliased to)
Then

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
